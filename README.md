 * 1920x1080, tired of fixing that for now.
 * I'll use the engine later for something else without pooling for `candles.length-1` with realtime websockets.

# Play 

`npm init`
`npm i` (aka npm install)
`npm start`
-> go fullscreen with terminal

# todo

* Select some specific relevant candles, maybe allow a selection in the future.
* Loop through all displayed candles and not just the last 5 ... and display patterns from candles indexes.
